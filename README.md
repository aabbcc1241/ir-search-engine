Teaching Objective:
===================
1. Gain hands-on experience in developing a search engine (objective ii and v);
2. Gain hands-on experience in the evaluation of search engines (objective ii and v);
3. Practice communication skill (Attributes of all-roundedness 3 and 4) during demo;

The Problem:
============
You have joined an information retrieval evaluation workshop hosted by me. You need to form *a group of size that is between 9 and 13 (inclusive)*. You should hand in details (i.e., full name, student id, group leader and his/her mobile phone contact) to me by **October 16th, 2015**. This workshop seeks to find the most effective and most efficient system that you can design and implement. You are given a set of TREC queries, a set of TREC relevance judgments and some inverted index data. You are required to further develop the system using MS Access or develop another system in C++ (in part or in whole) or another system developed in Java (in part or in whole) to retrieve and rank the given set of documents for the given set of queries. Due to the distribution agreement signed by me with TREC, I cannot distribute the TREC documents to you. However, the inverted index data is available for you to build a search engine.

Given Material (available in Blackboard):
=========================================
1. prog.zip (C++ programs; example IR system)
2. irproj.zip (programs, readme file, etc.)
3. file.txt (contains the mapping between file identifier and document name used for TREC evaluation)
4. post.txt (contains the inverted index information of the collection)
5. trec_eval.tar.gz (TREC evaluation program and its Windows version)
6. query.zip (Query and relevance judgement files)
   - judgerobust: contains the relevance judgment of each query
   - queryTDN: long queries
   - queryT: short queries
